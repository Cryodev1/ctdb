# ctdb

Classic Tetris Database is designed to be a data hub for the Classic Tetris community, storing information on players and matches as well as a comprehensive interface for interacting with said data. The plan is to include:

- A GraphQL API
- A traditional REST API
- Comprehensive documentation for both
- A web interface
- A Discord bot
- A Twitch bot
- Authenticated API endpoints for trusted automated match reporting
- A mechanism for Elo calculation and tweaking

The current scope is wide, and a little nebulous, but the fgoal is to chip away at our community vision: a central, organized, comprehensive, scalable archival system for the Classic Tetris community.

The `docs/` folder will serve as a source for documentation and other info until a proper site exists.
